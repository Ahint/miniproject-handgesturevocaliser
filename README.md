# Hand Gesture Vocaliser - Mini Project

The objective of this project is to create a basic prototype that captures specific gestures and translates them into audio and visual representations that can be universally understood. This initiative seeks to facilitate communication among individuals who are mute, deaf, or blind, as well as to improve their interactions with the general public.

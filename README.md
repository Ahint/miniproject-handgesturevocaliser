# Hand Gesture Vocaliser - Mini Project

The aim of this project is to develop a simple prototype by capturing select gestures and converting them into universally understandable audio and visual representations. This initiative is designed to enhance communication among mute, deaf, and blind communities, as well as their interaction with the broader populace.
